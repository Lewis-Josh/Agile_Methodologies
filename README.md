This was a final for a school project which I described the SDLC and analyzed Scrum-Agile Methodology compared to other approaches like Waterfall development. It contains an extensive sprint review for another project we were assigned to develop code for an imaginary travel agency with changing requirements.
Analyzing user needs and requirements, I used User Stories to help me comprehend the exact desires of the client. Having requirements clearly planned out before development is a key component to successful software development. My approach to developing programs is by using Agile Methodologies to continuously adapt, learn and improve upon performance. Agile Practices also include many opportunities for social interaction and development. Emphasizing communication and collaboration is key to being a team member in software development.
